##  Running Tests

To run all unit tests:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Or to test specific apps:

```bash
python manage.py test users
python manage.py test tracker
```

##  Notes

- All user session information is stored in a local `session.txt` file.
- The app uses SQLite by default, but you can configure any database via `settings.py`.
- `backup_data` creates a `backup.json` file containing all user and transaction info.
